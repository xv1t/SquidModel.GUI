	Defining an Access List

	acl aclname acltype string1 ...
	acl aclname acltype "file" ...

	when using "file", the file should contain one item per line

	acltype is one of the types described below

	By default, regular expressions are CASE-SENSITIVE.  To make
	them case-insensitive, use the -i option.

	acl aclname src      ip-address/netmask ... (clients IP address)
	acl aclname src      addr1-addr2/netmask ... (range of addresses)
	acl aclname dst      ip-address/netmask ... (URL host's IP address)
	acl aclname myip     ip-address/netmask ... (local socket IP address)

	acl aclname arp      mac-address ... (xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx notation)
	  # The arp ACL requires the special configure option --enable-arp-acl.
	  # Furthermore, the arp ACL code is not portable to all operating systems.
	  # It works on Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD and some other *BSD variants.
	  #
	  # NOTE: Squid can only determine the MAC address for clients that are on
	  # the same subnet. If the client is on a different subnet, then Squid cannot
	  # find out its MAC address.

	acl aclname srcdomain   .foo.com ...    # reverse lookup, client IP
	acl aclname dstdomain   .foo.com ...    # Destination server from URL
	acl aclname srcdom_regex [-i] xxx ...   # regex matching client name
	acl aclname dstdom_regex [-i] xxx ...   # regex matching server
	  # For dstdomain and dstdom_regex a reverse lookup is tried if a IP
	  # based URL is used and no match is found. The name "none" is used
	  # if the reverse lookup fails.

	acl aclname time     [day-abbrevs]  [h1:m1-h2:m2]
	    day-abbrevs:
		S - Sunday
		M - Monday
		T - Tuesday
		W - Wednesday
		H - Thursday
		F - Friday
		A - Saturday
	    h1:m1 must be less than h2:m2
	acl aclname url_regex [-i] ^http:// ...	# regex matching on whole URL
	acl aclname urlpath_regex [-i] \.gif$ ...	# regex matching on URL path
	acl aclname urllogin [-i] [^a-zA-Z0-9] ...	# regex matching on URL login field
	acl aclname port     80 70 21 ...
	acl aclname port     0-1024 ...		# ranges allowed
	acl aclname myport   3128 ...		# (local socket TCP port)
	acl aclname proto    HTTP FTP ...
	acl aclname method   GET POST ...
	acl aclname browser  [-i] regexp ...
	  # pattern match on User-Agent header (see also req_header below)
	acl aclname referer_regex  [-i] regexp ...
	  # pattern match on Referer header
	  # Referer is highly unreliable, so use with care
	acl aclname ident    username ...
	acl aclname ident_regex [-i] pattern ...
	  # string match on ident output.
	  # use REQUIRED to accept any non-null ident.
	acl aclname src_as   number ...
	acl aclname dst_as   number ...
	  # Except for access control, AS numbers can be used for
	  # routing of requests to specific caches. Here's an
	  # example for routing all requests for AS#1241 and only
	  # those to mycache.mydomain.net:
	  # acl asexample dst_as 1241
	  # cache_peer_access mycache.mydomain.net allow asexample
	  # cache_peer_access mycache_mydomain.net deny all

	acl aclname proxy_auth [-i] username ...
	acl aclname proxy_auth_regex [-i] pattern ...
	  # list of valid usernames
	  # use REQUIRED to accept any valid username.
	  #
	  # NOTE: when a Proxy-Authentication header is sent but it is not
	  # needed during ACL checking the username is NOT logged
	  # in access.log.
	  #
	  # NOTE: proxy_auth requires a EXTERNAL authentication program
	  # to check username/password combinations (see
	  # auth_param directive).
	  #
	  # NOTE: proxy_auth can't be used in a transparent proxy as
	  # the browser needs to be configured for using a proxy in order
	  # to respond to proxy authentication.

	acl aclname snmp_community string ...
	  # A community string to limit access to your SNMP Agent
	  # Example:
	  #
	  #	acl snmppublic snmp_community public

	acl aclname maxconn number
	  # This will be matched when the client's IP address has
	  # more than &lt;number&gt; HTTP connections established.

	acl aclname max_user_ip [-s] number
	  # This will be matched when the user attempts to log in from more
	  # than &lt;number&gt; different ip addresses. The authenticate_ip_ttl
	  # parameter controls the timeout on the ip entries.
	  # If -s is specified the limit is strict, denying browsing
	  # from any further IP addresses until the ttl has expired. Without
	  # -s Squid will just annoy the user by "randomly" denying requests.
	  # (the counter is reset each time the limit is reached and a
	  # request is denied)
	  # NOTE: in acceleration mode or where there is mesh of child proxies,
	  # clients may appear to come from multiple addresses if they are
	  # going through proxy farms, so a limit of 1 may cause user problems.

	acl aclname req_mime_type mime-type1 ...
	  # regex match against the mime type of the request generated
	  # by the client. Can be used to detect file upload or some
	  # types HTTP tunneling requests.
	  # NOTE: This does NOT match the reply. You cannot use this
	  # to match the returned file type.

	acl aclname req_header header-name [-i] any\.regex\.here
	  # regex match against any of the known request headers.  May be
	  # thought of as a superset of "browser", "referer" and "mime-type"
	  # ACLs.

	acl aclname rep_mime_type mime-type1 ...
	  # regex match against the mime type of the reply received by
	  # squid. Can be used to detect file download or some
	  # types HTTP tunneling requests.
	  # NOTE: This has no effect in http_access rules. It only has
	  # effect in rules that affect the reply data stream such as
	  # http_reply_access.

	acl aclname rep_header header-name [-i] any\.regex\.here
	  # regex match against any of the known reply headers. May be
	  # thought of as a superset of "browser", "referer" and "mime-type"
	  # ACLs.
	  #
	  # Example:
	  #
	  # acl many_spaces rep_header Content-Disposition -i [[:space:]]{3,}

	acl acl_name external class_name [arguments...]
	  # external ACL lookup via a helper class defined by the
	  # external_acl_type directive.

	acl urlgroup group1 ...
	  # match against the urlgroup as indicated by redirectors

	acl aclname user_cert attribute values...
	  # match against attributes in a user SSL certificate
	  # attribute is one of DN/C/O/CN/L/ST

	acl aclname ca_cert attribute values...
	  # match against attributes a users issuing CA SSL certificate
	  # attribute is one of DN/C/O/CN/L/ST

	acl aclname ext_user username ...
	acl aclname ext_user_regex [-i] pattern ...
	  # string match on username returned by external acl helper
	  # use REQUIRED to accept any non-null user name.

Examples:
acl macaddress arp 09:00:2b:23:45:67
acl myexample dst_as 1241
acl password proxy_auth REQUIRED
acl fileupload req_mime_type -i ^multipart/form-data$
acl javascript rep_mime_type -i ^application/x-javascript$
