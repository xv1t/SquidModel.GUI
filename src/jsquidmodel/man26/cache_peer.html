	To specify other caches in a hierarchy, use the format:

		cache_peer hostname type http-port icp-port [options]

	For example,

	#                                        proxy  icp
	#          hostname             type     port   port  options
	#          -------------------- -------- ----- -----  -----------
	cache_peer parent.foo.net       parent    3128  3130  proxy-only default
	cache_peer sib1.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only
	cache_peer sib2.foo.net         sibling   3128  3130  proxy-only

	      type:  either 'parent', 'sibling', or 'multicast'.

	proxy-port:  The port number where the cache listens for proxy
		     requests.

	  icp-port:  Used for querying neighbor caches about
		     objects.  To have a non-ICP neighbor
		     specify '7' for the ICP port and make sure the
		     neighbor machine has the UDP echo port
		     enabled in its /etc/inetd.conf file.
		NOTE: Also requires icp_port option enabled to send/receive
		      requests via this method.

	    options: proxy-only
		     weight=n
		     ttl=n
		     no-query
		     default
		     round-robin
		     carp
		     multicast-responder
		     closest-only
		     no-digest
		     no-netdb-exchange
		     no-delay
		     login=user:password | PASS | *:password
		     connect-timeout=nn
		     digest-url=url
		     allow-miss
		     max-conn=n
		     htcp
		     htcp-oldsquid
		     originserver
		     userhash
		     sourcehash
		     name=xxx
		     monitorurl=url
		     monitorsize=sizespec
		     monitorinterval=seconds
		     monitortimeout=seconds
		     forceddomain=name
		     ssl
		     sslcert=/path/to/ssl/certificate
		     sslkey=/path/to/ssl/key
		     sslversion=1|2|3|4
		     sslcipher=...
		     ssloptions=...
		     front-end-https[=on|auto]
		     connection-auth[=on|off|auto]

		     use 'proxy-only' to specify objects fetched
		     from this cache should not be saved locally.

		     use 'weight=n' to affect the selection of a peer
		     during any weighted peer-selection mechanisms.
		     The weight must be an integer; default is 1,
		     larger weights are favored more.
		     This option does not affect parent selection if a peering
		     protocol is not in use.

		     use 'ttl=n' to specify a IP multicast TTL to use
		     when sending an ICP queries to this address.
		     Only useful when sending to a multicast group.
		     Because we don't accept ICP replies from random
		     hosts, you must configure other group members as
		     peers with the 'multicast-responder' option below.

		     use 'no-query' to NOT send ICP queries to this
		     neighbor.

		     use 'default' if this is a parent cache which can
		     be used as a "last-resort" if a peer cannot be located
		     by any of the peer-selection mechanisms.
		     If specified more than once, only the first is used.

		     use 'round-robin' to define a set of parents which
		     should be used in a round-robin fashion in the
		     absence of any ICP queries.

		     use 'carp' to define a set of parents which should
		     be used as a CARP array. The requests will be
		     distributed among the parents based on the CARP load
		     balancing hash function based on their weight.

		     'multicast-responder' indicates the named peer
		     is a member of a multicast group.  ICP queries will
		     not be sent directly to the peer, but ICP replies
		     will be accepted from it.

		     'closest-only' indicates that, for ICP_OP_MISS
		     replies, we'll only forward CLOSEST_PARENT_MISSes
		     and never FIRST_PARENT_MISSes.

		     use 'no-digest' to NOT request cache digests from
		     this neighbor.

		     'no-netdb-exchange' disables requesting ICMP
		     RTT database (NetDB) from the neighbor.

		     use 'no-delay' to prevent access to this neighbor
		     from influencing the delay pools.

		     use 'login=user:password' if this is a personal/workgroup
		     proxy and your parent requires proxy authentication.
		     Note: The string can include URL escapes (i.e. %20 for
		     spaces). This also means % must be written as %%.

		     use 'login=PASS' if users must authenticate against
		     the upstream proxy or in the case of a reverse proxy
		     configuration, the origin web server.  This will pass
		     the users credentials as they are to the peer.
		     Note: To combine this with local authentication the Basic
		     authentication scheme must be used, and both servers must
		     share the same user database as HTTP only allows for
		     a single login (one for proxy, one for origin server).
		     Also be warned this will expose your users proxy
		     password to the peer. USE WITH CAUTION

		     use 'login=*:password' to pass the username to the
		     upstream cache, but with a fixed password. This is meant
		     to be used when the peer is in another administrative
		     domain, but it is still needed to identify each user.
		     The star can optionally be followed by some extra
		     information which is added to the username. This can
		     be used to identify this proxy to the peer, similar to
		     the login=username:password option above.

		     use 'connect-timeout=nn' to specify a peer
		     specific connect timeout (also see the
		     peer_connect_timeout directive)

		     use 'digest-url=url' to tell Squid to fetch the cache
		     digest (if digests are enabled) for this host from
		     the specified URL rather than the Squid default
		     location.

		     use 'allow-miss' to disable Squid's use of only-if-cached
		     when forwarding requests to siblings. This is primarily
		     useful when icp_hit_stale is used by the sibling. To
		     extensive use of this option may result in forwarding
		     loops, and you should avoid having two-way peerings
		     with this option. (for example to deny peer usage on
		     requests from peer by denying cache_peer_access if the
		     source is a peer)

		     use 'max-conn=n' to limit the amount of connections Squid
		     may open to this peer.

		     use 'htcp' to send HTCP, instead of ICP, queries
		     to the neighbor.  You probably also want to
		     set the "icp port" to 4827 instead of 3130.
		     You must also allow this Squid htcp_access and
		     http_access in the peer Squid configuration.

		     use 'htcp-oldsquid' to send HTCP to old Squid versions
		     You must also allow this Squid htcp_access and
		     http_access in the peer Squid configuration.

		     'originserver' causes this parent peer to be contacted as
		     a origin server. Meant to be used in accelerator setups.

		     use 'userhash' to load-balance amongst a set of parents
		     based on the client proxy_auth or ident username.

		     use 'sourcehash' to load-balance amongst a set of parents
		     based on the client source ip.

		     use 'name=xxx' if you have multiple peers on the same
		     host but different ports. This name can be used to
		     differentiate the peers in cache_peer_access and similar
		     directives.

		     use 'monitorurl=url' to have periodically request a given
		     URL from the peer, and only consider the peer as alive
		     if this monitoring is successful (default none)

		     use 'monitorsize=min[-max]' to limit the size range of
		     'monitorurl' replies considered valid. Defaults to 0 to
		     accept any size replies as valid.

		     use 'monitorinterval=seconds' to change frequency of
		     how often the peer is monitored with 'monitorurl'
		     (default 300 for a 5 minute interval). If set to 0
		     then monitoring is disabled even if a URL is defined.

		     use 'monitortimeout=seconds' to change the timeout of
		     'monitorurl'. Defaults to 'monitorinterval'.

		     use 'forceddomain=name' to forcibly set the Host header
		     of requests forwarded to this peer. Useful in accelerator
		     setups where the server (peer) expects a certain domain
		     name and using redirectors to feed this domain name
		     is not feasible.

		     use 'ssl' to indicate connections to this peer should
		     be SSL/TLS encrypted.

		     use 'sslcert=/path/to/ssl/certificate' to specify a client
		     SSL certificate to use when connecting to this peer.

		     use 'sslkey=/path/to/ssl/key' to specify the private SSL
		     key corresponding to sslcert above. If 'sslkey' is not
		     specified 'sslcert' is assumed to reference a
		     combined file containing both the certificate and the key.

		     use sslversion=1|2|3|4 to specify the SSL version to use
		     when connecting to this peer
			1 = automatic (default)
			2 = SSL v2 only
			3 = SSL v3 only
			4 = TLS v1 only

		     use sslcipher=... to specify the list of valid SSL ciphers
		     to use when connecting to this peer.

		     use ssloptions=... to specify various SSL engine options:
			NO_SSLv2  Disallow the use of SSLv2
			NO_SSLv3  Disallow the use of SSLv3
			NO_TLSv1  Disallow the use of TLSv1
		     See src/ssl_support.c or the OpenSSL documentation for
		     a more complete list.

		     use sslcafile=... to specify a file containing
		     additional CA certificates to use when verifying the
		     peer certificate.

		     use sslcapath=... to specify a directory containing
		     additional CA certificates to use when verifying the
		     peer certificate.

		     use sslcrlfile=... to specify a certificate revocation
		     list file to use when verifying the peer certificate.

		     use sslflags=... to specify various flags modifying the
		     SSL implementation:
			DONT_VERIFY_PEER
				Accept certificates even if they fail to
				verify.
			NO_DEFAULT_CA
				Don't use the default CA list built in
				to OpenSSL.

		     use ssldomain= to specify the peer name as advertised
		     in it's certificate. Used for verifying the correctness
		     of the received peer certificate. If not specified the
		     peer hostname will be used.

		     use front-end-https to enable the "Front-End-Https: On"
		     header needed when using Squid as a SSL frontend in front
		     of Microsoft OWA. See MS KB document Q307347 for details
		     on this header. If set to auto the header will
		     only be added if the request is forwarded as a https://
		     URL.

		     use connection-auth=off to tell Squid that this peer does
		     not support Microsoft connection oriented authentication,
		     and any such challenges received from there should be
		     ignored. Default is auto to automatically determine the
		     status of the peer.
