	This is used to define parameters for the various authentication
	schemes supported by Squid.

	format: auth_param scheme parameter [setting]

	The order in which authentication schemes are presented to the client is
	dependent on the order the scheme first appears in config file. IE
	has a bug (it's not RFC 2617 compliant) in that it will use the basic
	scheme if basic is the first entry presented, even if more secure
	schemes are presented. For now use the order in the recommended
	settings section below. If other browsers have difficulties (don't
	recognize the schemes offered even if you are using basic) either
	put basic first, or disable the other schemes (by commenting out their
	program entry).

	Once an authentication scheme is fully configured, it can only be
	shutdown by shutting squid down and restarting. Changes can be made on
	the fly and activated with a reconfigure. I.E. You can change to a
	different helper, but not unconfigure the helper completely.

	Please note that while this directive defines how Squid processes
	authentication it does not automatically activate authentication.
	To use authentication you must in addition make use of ACLs based
	on login name in http_access (proxy_auth, proxy_auth_regex or
	external with %LOGIN used in the format tag). The browser will be
	challenged for authentication on the first such acl encountered
	in http_access processing and will also be re-challenged for new
	login credentials if the request is being denied by a proxy_auth
	type acl.

	WARNING: authentication can't be used in a transparently intercepting
	proxy as the client then thinks it is talking to an origin server and
	not the proxy. This is a limitation of bending the TCP/IP protocol to
	transparently intercepting port 80, not a limitation in Squid.

	=== Parameters for the basic scheme follow. ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a program
	reads a line containing "username password" and replies "OK" or
	"ERR" in an endless loop. "ERR" responses may optionally be followed
	by a error description available as %m in the returned error page.

	By default, the basic authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	If you want to use the traditional proxy authentication, jump over to
	the helpers/basic_auth/NCSA directory and type:
		% make
		% make install

	Then, set this line to something like

	auth_param basic program /usr/local/squid/libexec/ncsa_auth /usr/local/squid/etc/passwd

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn. If you start too few
	squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of credential
	verifications, slowing it down. When credential verifications are
	done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
	authenticator processes.
	auth_param basic children 5

	"concurrency" numberofconcurrentrequests
	The number of concurrent requests/channels the helper supports.
	Changes the protocol used to include a channel number first on
	the request/response line, allowing multiple requests to be sent
	to the same helper in parallell without wating for the response.
	Must not be set unless it's known the helper supports this.

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the client for
	the basic proxy authentication scheme (part of the text the user
	will see when prompted their username and password).
	auth_param basic realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"credentialsttl" timetolive
	Specifies how long squid assumes an externally validated
	username:password pair is valid for - in other words how often the
	helper program is called for that user. Set this low to force
	revalidation with short lived passwords.  Note that setting this high
	does not impact your susceptibility to replay attacks unless you are
	using an one-time password system (such as SecureID). If you are using
	such a system, you will be vulnerable to replay attacks unless you
	also use the max_user_ip ACL in an http_access rule.
	auth_param basic credentialsttl 2 hours

	"casesensitive" on|off
	Specifies if usernames are case sensitive. Most user databases are
	case insensitive allowing the same username to be spelled using both
	lower and upper case letters, but some are case sensitive. This
	makes a big difference for user_max_ip ACL processing and similar.
	auth_param basic casesensitive off

	"blankpassword" on|off
	Specifies if blank passwords should be supported. Defaults to off
	as there is multiple authentication backends which handles blank
	passwords as "guest" access.

	=== Parameters for the digest scheme follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external authenticator.  Such a program
	reads a line containing "username":"realm" and replies with the
	appropriate H(A1) value hex encoded or ERR if the user (or his H(A1)
	hash) does not exists.  See RFC 2616 for the definition of H(A1).
	"ERR" responses may optionally be followed by a error description
	available as %m in the returned error page.

	By default, the digest authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	If you want to use a digest authenticator, jump over to the
	helpers/digest_auth/ directory and choose the authenticator to use.
	It it's directory type
		% make
		% make install

	Then, set this line to something like

	auth_param digest program /usr/local/squid/libexec/digest_auth_pw /usr/local/squid/etc/digpass

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn. If you start too few
	squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of credential
	verifications, slowing it down. When credential verifications are
	done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
	authenticator processes.
	auth_param digest children 5

	"concurrency" numberofconcurrentrequests
	The number of concurrent requests/channels the helper supports.
	Changes the protocol used to include a channel number first on
	the request/response line, allowing multiple requests to be sent
	to the same helper in parallell without wating for the response.
	Must not be set unless it's known the helper supports this.

	"realm" realmstring
	Specifies the realm name which is to be reported to the client for the
	digest proxy authentication scheme (part of the text the user will see
	when prompted their username and password).
	auth_param digest realm Squid proxy-caching web server

	"nonce_garbage_interval" timeinterval
	Specifies the interval that nonces that have been issued to clients are
	checked for validity.
	auth_param digest nonce_garbage_interval 5 minutes

	"nonce_max_duration" timeinterval
	Specifies the maximum length of time a given nonce will be valid for.
	auth_param digest nonce_max_duration 30 minutes

	"nonce_max_count" number
	Specifies the maximum number of times a given nonce can be used.
	auth_param digest nonce_max_count 50

	"nonce_strictness" on|off
	Determines if squid requires strict increment-by-1 behavior for nonce
	counts, or just incrementing (off - for use when useragents generate
	nonce counts that occasionally miss 1 (ie, 1,2,4,6)).
	auth_param digest nonce_strictness off

	"check_nonce_count" on|off
	This directive if set to off can disable the nonce count check
	completely to work around buggy digest qop implementations in certain
	mainstream browser versions. Default on to check the nonce count to
	protect from authentication replay attacks.
	auth_param digest check_nonce_count on

	"post_workaround" on|off
	This is a workaround to certain buggy browsers who sends an incorrect
	request digest in POST requests when reusing the same nonce as acquired
	earlier in response to a GET request.
	auth_param digest post_workaround off

	=== NTLM scheme options follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external NTLM authenticator. Such a
	program participates in the NTLMSSP exchanges between Squid and the
	client and reads commands according to the Squid NTLMSSP helper
	protocol. See helpers/ntlm_auth/ for details. Recommended ntlm
	authenticator is ntlm_auth from Samba-3.X, but a number of other
	ntlm authenticators is available.

	By default, the ntlm authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	auth_param ntlm program /path/to/samba/bin/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=squid-2.5-ntlmssp

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn. If you start too few
	squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of credential
	verifications, slowing it down. When credential verifications are
	done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
	authenticator processes.
	auth_param ntlm children 5

	"keep_alive" on|off
	This option enables the use of keep-alive on the initial
	authentication request. It has been reported some versions of MSIE
	have problems if this is enabled, but performance will be increased
	if enabled.

	auth_param ntlm keep_alive on

	=== Negotiate scheme options follow ===

	"program" cmdline
	Specify the command for the external Negotiate authenticator. Such a
	program participates in the SPNEGO exchanges between Squid and the
	client and reads commands according to the Squid ntlmssp helper
	protocol. See helpers/ntlm_auth/ for details. Recommended SPNEGO
	authenticator is ntlm_auth from Samba-4.X.

	By default, the Negotiate authentication scheme is not used unless a
	program is specified.

	auth_param negotiate program /path/to/samba/bin/ntlm_auth --helper-protocol=gss-spnego

	"children" numberofchildren
	The number of authenticator processes to spawn. If you start too few
	squid will have to wait for them to process a backlog of credential
	verifications, slowing it down. When credential verifications are
	done via a (slow) network you are likely to need lots of
	authenticator processes.
	auth_param negotiate children 5

	"keep_alive" on|off
	If you experience problems with PUT/POST requests when using the
	Negotiate authentication scheme then you can try setting this to
	off. This will cause Squid to forcibly close the connection on
	the initial requests where the browser asks which schemes are
	supported by the proxy.

	auth_param negotiate keep_alive on
